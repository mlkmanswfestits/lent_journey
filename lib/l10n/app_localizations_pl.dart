He and his elder brother were raised and educated at the Narek monastery by their scholarly uncle, Anania Narekatsi. Gregory entered monastic life at a young age, was ordained a priest around 977, and spent his entire life at the Narek monastery, teaching theology. His most celebrated work is \'The Book of Lamentations,\' also known as \'Narek,\' a collection of 95 prayers exploring themes of humanity\'s separation from God and the quest for reunification. In 2015, Pope Francis declared St. Gregory of Narek a Doctor of the Church, acknowledging the timeless and theologically sound nature of his writings.

He holds a unique position in Church history as he was personally taught by the Apostle John, one of Jesus\'s disciples. His direct connection to the apostles made him a crucial figure in authenticating orthodox teachings and combating early heresies, particularly Gnosticism. Born around AD 69 or 70, Polycarp became bishop of Smyrna, a role he held for approximately six decades. During his time as bishop, he fiercely defended the faith against emerging heresies. He also engaged in discussions with other early Church leaders, including Pope Anicetus, regarding important matters like the date of Easter celebrations. Polycarp\'s steadfast faith culminated in his martyrdom at 86 years old. When the flames reportedly failed to consume his body during his execution, he was ultimately killed by a dagger. His trust in God, even in the face of death, exemplifies a deep Lenten theme of unwavering faith and sacrifice.';

From a young age, he was educated by holy men and embraced a disciplined, even severe, life, often sleeping on the ground and engaging in penitential practices. He spent long nights in prayer, meditating on the Passion of Christ, and vowed lifelong celibacy. After a failed military campaign to claim the throne of Hungary at age 13, he resolved never to be involved in war again. Known for his generosity towards the sick and poor, earning him the title \'patron of the poor,\' he also had a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. He died at the age of 25 from tuberculosis.
