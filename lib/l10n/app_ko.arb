  "saintGregoryNarekName": "St. Gregory of Narek",
  "saintGregoryNarekFeast": "February 27",
  "saintGregoryNarekPatronage": "Armenian Church",
  "saintGregoryNarekBio": "St. Gregory of Narek (c. 950 – 1003) was a highly influential Armenian mystical and lyrical poet, monk, and theologian. Born near Lake Van in what is now Turkey, Gregory came from a family deeply dedicated to the Church. He and his elder brother were raised and educated at the Narek monastery by their scholarly uncle, Anania Narekatsi. Gregory entered monastic life at a young age, was ordained a priest around 977, and spent his entire life at the Narek monastery, teaching theology. His most celebrated work is 'The Book of Lamentations,' also known as 'Narek,' a collection of 95 prayers exploring themes of humanity's separation from God and the quest for reunification. In 2015, Pope Francis declared St. Gregory of Narek a Doctor of the Church, acknowledging the timeless and theologically sound nature of his writings. His life of prayer and deep reflection offers a powerful model for Lenten spiritual growth.",
  "saintGregoryNarekQuote": "Accept the song of blessing from my lips.",
  "saintGregoryNarekPrayer": "O Lord our God, who didst grant to the monk Saint Gregory of Narek the grace of a humble heart and a sublime spirit, grant that through his intercession we may ever seek Thee through a life of prayer and charity. Amen.",

  "saintPolycarpName": "St. Polycarp",
  "saintPolycarpFeast": "February 23",
  "saintPolycarpPatronage": "Earaches, dysentery",
  "saintPolycarpBio": "St. Polycarp (c. AD 69 – 155) served as the Christian Bishop of Smyrna and is recognized as an Apostolic Father, bridging the gap between the apostolic and patristic ages of the Church. He holds a unique position in Church history as he was personally taught by the Apostle John, one of Jesus's disciples. His direct connection to the apostles made him a crucial figure in authenticating orthodox teachings and combating early heresies, particularly Gnosticism. Born around AD 69 or 70, Polycarp became bishop of Smyrna, a role he held for approximately six decades. During his time as bishop, he fiercely defended the faith against emerging heresies. He also engaged in discussions with other early Church leaders, including Pope Anicetus, regarding important matters like the date of Easter celebrations. Polycarp's steadfast faith culminated in his martyrdom at 86 years old. When the flames reportedly failed to consume his body during his execution, he was ultimately killed by a dagger. His trust in God, even in the face of death, exemplifies a deep Lenten theme of unwavering faith and sacrifice.",
  "saintPolycarpQuote": "Eighty and six years have I served Him, and He has done me no wrong.",
  "saintPolycarpPrayer": "O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank Thee for having counted us worthy of this day and hour, that we might receive a portion among the number of martyrs, through Christ our Lord. Amen.",

  "saintCasimirName": "St. Casimir",
  "saintCasimirFeast": "March 4",
  "saintCasimirPatronage": "Lithuania, Poland, youth",
  "saintCasimirBio": "St. Casimir (1458 – 1484) was a prince of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Despite his royal lineage and being in line for the throne, Casimir chose a life of profound piety, prayer, and renunciation of worldly luxuries. From a young age, he was educated by holy men and embraced a disciplined, even severe, life, often sleeping on the ground and engaging in penitential practices. He spent long nights in prayer, meditating on the Passion of Christ, and vowed lifelong celibacy. After a failed military campaign to claim the throne of Hungary at age 13, he resolved never to be involved in war again. Known for his generosity towards the sick and poor, earning him the title 'patron of the poor,' he also had a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. He died at the age of 25 from tuberculosis. His life offers a powerful example of detachment from worldly power and wealth, focusing instead on humility and prayer—themes central to Lent.",
  "saintCasimirQuote": "Rather die than sin.",
  "saintCasimirPrayer": "O God, who among the pleasures of a royal court and the snares of the world didst strengthen Saint Casimir with constant fidelity, we besuch Thee that we may be ever intent upon things heavenly. Amen.",

  "saintPerpetuaFelicityName": "Sts. Perpetua and Felicity",
  "saintPerpetuaFelicityFeast": "March 7",
  "saintPerpetuaFelicityPatronage": "Mothers, expectant mothers",
  "saintPerpetuaFelicityBio": "Sts. Perpetua and Felicity were two young women martyred for their faith in Carthage around 203 AD. Perpetua was a noblewoman and Felicity was her slave. Despite their social differences, they were united by their shared faith and the trials they faced. Perpetua, a young mother with an infant son, and Felicity, who was eight months pregnant when arrested, both refused to renounce Christ despite intense pressure from their families and the Roman authorities. Perpetua kept a diary in prison, which became one of the earliest pieces of Christian writing by a woman. They were ultimately killed in the arena, facing their deaths with remarkable courage and dignity. Their story is a profound witness to the power of sisterhood in Christ and the strength found in faith even amidst extreme suffering, echoing the Lenten journey of sacrifice and devotion.",
  "saintPerpetuaFelicityQuote": "Stand fast in the faith, and love one another.",
  "saintPerpetuaFelicityPrayer": "O God, at whose urging the Saints Perpetua and Felicity defied their persecutors and overcame the torment of death, grant, we beseech Thee, by their prayers, that we may be enabled to fulfill that which Thou commandest. Amen.",

  "saintJohnOfGodName": "St. John of God",
  "saintJohnOfGodFeast": "March 8",
  "saintJohnOfGodPatronage": "Hospitals, booksellers, the sick",
  "saintJohnOfGodBio": "St. John of God (1495 – 1550) led a discovery-filled early life as a shepherd and soldier before a profound spiritual awakening around age 40. Hearing a sermon by St. John of Avila, he was moved to extreme public repentance, which initially led to his committal to a mental hospital. Upon release, he dedicated his life to caring for the sick and poor in Granada, Spain. He established a house for the destitute, begging for food and medicine, and often carrying the ill to his home himself. His selflessness became the foundation for the Brothers Hospitallers. He died after falling ill while trying to save people during a flood. His journey from a worldly life to one of radical charity serves as a powerful Lenten inspiration for conversion and selfless service.",
  "saintJohnOfGodQuote": "Labor without stopping to do all the good of which you are capable.",
  "saintJohnOfGodPrayer": "O God, who filled Saint John of God with the spirit of mercy and made him wonderful in his charity toward the poor and the sick, grant through his intercession that we may practice charity and merit the Kingdom. Amen.",

  "saintFrancesOfRomeName": "St. Frances of Rome",
  "saintFrancesOfRomeFeast": "March 9",
  "saintFrancesOfRomePatronage": "Motorists, widows",
  "saintFrancesOfRomeBio": "St. Frances of Rome (1384 – 1440) was a mystic and mother known for her extraordinary charity and humility. Despite her desire to be a nun, she entered a happy 40-year marriage and became an exemplary wife and mother. During famines and plagues in Rome, she heroically cared for the sick, distributing her own wealth and organizing other noble ladies to assist. She even turned part of her family home into a hospital. Known for her visions and the gift of seeing her guardian angel, she eventually founded a community of oblates. Her life demonstrates how to find God in both family duties and contemplative service, a lesson of balance and dedication relevant for any Lenten spiritual practice.",
  "saintFrancesOfRomeQuote": "A married woman must, when called upon, quit her devotions to God at the altar to find Him in her household affairs.",
  "saintFrancesOfRomePrayer": "O God, who hast given us in Saint Frances of Rome a model of holiness in both married and religious life, grant that we may serve Thee with such constancy that we may behold Thee in all things. Amen.",

  "saintPatrickName": "St. Patrick",
  "saintPatrickFeast": "March 17",
  "saintPatrickPatronage": "Ireland, engineers",
  "saintPatrickBio": "St. Patrick (c. 385 – 461) is the patron saint of Ireland, credited with bringing Christianity to the country. Captured by pirates at age 16 and taken to Ireland as a slave, he spent six years as a shepherd, during which he underwent a deep spiritual conversion through constant prayer. After escaping back to Britain, he studied for the priesthood and eventually returned to Ireland as a missionary bishop. He successfully spread Christian teachings by incorporating elements of Irish culture, converting kings and entire kingdoms. His life, documented in his 'Confessio,' is a testament to redemption, perseverance, and the power of faith to transform suffering into a divine mission—a perfect reflection for the Lenten season.",
  "saintPatrickQuote": "Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me.",
  "saintPatrickPrayer": "O Lord, who didst send Thy blessed Saint Patrick to preach Thy glory to the Gentiles, grant that, by his merits and intercession, we may be enabled to fulfill that which Thou commandest. Amen.",

  "saintCyrilJerusalemName": "St. Cyril of Jerusalem",
  "saintCyrilJerusalemFeast": "March 18",
  "saintCyrilJerusalemPatronage": "Theologians, catechists",
  "saintCyrilJerusalemBio": "St. Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 313 – 386) was a Bishop of Jerusalem and a Doctor of the Church. He lived during a period of intense theological debate and was a staunch defender of orthodox belief against Arianism, leading to his exile three times. During a famine, he sold church valuables to buy food for the starving. His 23 'Catechetical Lectures,' delivered to candidates for Baptism during Lent and to the newly baptized after Easter, provided profound explanations of the creed and the mysteries of salvation. His dedication to instruction and the formation of the faithful makes him a vital guide for Lenten preparation.",
  "saintCyrilJerusalemQuote": "The Dragon sits by the side of the road, watching those who pass. Beware lest he devour you.",
  "saintCyrilJerusalemPrayer": "O God, who through the Bishop Saint Cyril of Jerusalem didst wonderfully lead Thy Church to a deeper understanding of the mysteries of salvation, grant that we may so honor Him that we may merit the same glory. Amen.",

  "saintJosephName": "St. Joseph",
  "saintJosephFeast": "March 19",
  "saintJosephPatronage": "Universal Church, fathers, workers",
  "saintJosephBio": "St. Joseph, the chaste spouse of Mary and foster-father of Jesus, is the model of quiet strength and obedience. A humble carpenter from Nazareth, he protected the Holy Family, leading them to Egypt to escape Herod and providing for them through his trade. Though the Gospels record no spoken words from him, his actions reveal a man of profound faith who trusted God's messengers in his dreams. He is the patron of the Universal Church and for a happy death. His silent service and unwavering faith offer a deep Lenten model of humble surrender to God's will.",
  "saintJosephQuote": "He was a just man.",
  "saintJosephPrayer": "O Saint Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the Throne of God, I place in thee all my interests and desires. Obtain for me through thy powerful intercession all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ. Amen.",

  "saintTuribiusName": "St. Turibius of Mogrovejo",
  "saintTuribiusFeast": "March 23",
  "saintTuribiusPatronage": "Latin American Bishops, native rights",
  "saintTuribiusBio": "St. Turibius (1538 – 1606) was a brilliant Spanish lawyer appointed Archbishop of Lima, Peru. Appalled by the injustices against indigenous peoples and clerical abuses, he dedicated his 26-year mission to reform. He traveled over 6,000 miles across his vast diocese, often on foot, learning local languages and defending the rights of the native inhabitants. He established schools, hospitals, and the first seminary in the Americas. His tireless advocacy for justice and his missionary zeal reflect the Lenten call to penance through action and solidarity with the marginalized.",
  "saintTuribiusQuote": "Time is not our own, and we must give a strict account of it.",
  "saintTuribiusPrayer": "O God, who didst increase Thy Church through the apostolic labors of Saint Turibius, grant that the people consecrated to Thee may ever receive an increase of faith and holiness. Amen.",

  "saintFrancisPaolaName": "St. Francis of Paola",
  "saintFrancisPaolaFeast": "April 2",
  "saintFrancisPaolaPatronage": "Seafarers, mariners",
  "saintFrancisPaolaBio": "St. Francis of Paola (1416 – 1507) was the founder of the Order of Minims, dedicated to extreme humility and penance. At age 13, he became a hermit, living in a cave until followers joined him. He instituted a rule that included a 'perpetual Lent'—a vow to abstain forever from all meat and animal products. Known as a wonderworker and prophet, he challenged rulers and spent his final years in the French court, helping King Louis XI prepare for death. His life of radical asceticism remains a powerful challenge and inspiration during the Lenten season.",
  "saintFrancisPaolaQuote": "Fix your minds on the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ out of love for us.",
  "saintFrancisPaolaPrayer": "O God, who didst raise Saint Francis of Paola to be a model of humility and penance, grant that through his intercession we may merit the rewards promised to the humble. Amen.",

  "saintKatharineDrexelFeast": "March 3",
  "saintKatharineDrexelPatronage": "Racial justice, philanthropists",
  "saintKatharineDrexelBio": "St. Katharine Drexel (1858 – 1955) was a Philadelphia heiress who gave up her $20 million fortune to serve Native and African Americans. Deeply moved by their mistreatment, she founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. Over her 96-year life, she established dozens of schools, mission stations, and Xavier University in New Orleans. She was a tireless advocate for racial justice and equality, reminding the world that the Eucharist calls us to radical love for all God's children. Her sacrifice of wealth for the sake of the Gospel is a profound Lenten witness of detachment and charity.",
  "saintKatharineDrexelQuote": "The patient and humble endurance of the cross is the highest perfection.",
  "saintKatharineDrexelPrayer": "O God, who called Saint Katharine Drexel to serve the oppressed, grant us the grace to follow her example of charity and justice. Amen.",
